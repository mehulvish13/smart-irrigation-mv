# 🌾 Smart Irrigation System using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project implements a **Smart Irrigation System** using **Machine Learning** to automate irrigation decisions based on real-time agricultural data. The system predicts the optimal irrigation mode by analyzing multiple environmental factors, helping conserve water and improve crop productivity.

---

## Key Features

- 🌱 **Data-Driven Irrigation Decisions**  
  Uses sensor data like soil moisture, temperature, and humidity to automate irrigation.

- 🤖 **Machine Learning Model**  
  Trains a **Random Forest Classifier** wrapped in a **MultiOutputClassifier** for multi-label prediction of irrigation modes.

- 📈 **Data Preprocessing & Normalization**  
  Uses **MinMaxScaler** to normalize features for better model performance.

- 💾 **Model Saving and Reusability**  
  Exports trained models using `joblib` for later deployment or inference.

## How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


2. **Run the notebook**

```bash
jupyter notebook irrigstion_SYS_mv.ipynb
```

3. **Train the model**  
   Follow the notebook steps to train and save the model as `Farm_Irrigation_System.pkl`.

4. **Run the Streamlit Web App**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch a web interface where you can input sensor values and get irrigation status predictions for each parcel.

## Future Improvements

- Integration with IoT devices for real-time sensor data.
- Deploying the model as a web API using Flask/FastAPI.
- Adding cloud storage support for large-scale farming.
